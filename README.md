# StatLearningBigData_Project2

Second project in Brown Universty's Statistical Learning and Big Data course Spring 2021 taught by Dr. Alice Paul

# Goal

This project focuses on continuing exploration of the data by applying two types of unsupervised learning seen in class - principal components analysis (PCA) and clustering. The goal is to understand more about the patterns or structure of the data through this analysis.  The data set I chose for this class was the Hotel Booking Data Set published by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida and Luis Nunes. This data set features booking information for 119k hotel reservations. The data was gathered directly from hotel property management system databases using SQL Server Studio Manager, and contains 32 attributes. The question that motivates this data set is whether or not certain booking features can be used to predict whether a booking will be canceled or not.

# Report Details
The assignment requested the  following information:

Introduction:  
Remind me briefly about your data  
Briefly motivate any questions you will be focused on answering through your analysis  

Principal components analysis:  
What question(s) might PCA be helpful in answering about your data?  
What do you notice about the results?  
If appropriate, can you interpret the components that capture the highest amount of variance within the data? What does that tell you about the data?  
Are there any new questions that were raised by the results?  
Be sure to include appropriate figures, tables, or summaries.  

Clustering:   
What question(s) might clustering be helpful in answering about your data?  
What type of clustering are you applying and why?  
What do you notice about the results?  
What do the resulting clusters tell you about the data?  
Are there any new questions that were raised by the results?  
Be sure to include appropriate figures, tables, or summaries.  

Conclusion  
Summarize what you learned about your data through this project  
How might your results affect your approach to predictive questions in future projects?
